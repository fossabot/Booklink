## What is Booklink :question:
Booklink is a web application that provides a platform for users to access and manage digital books. It aims to offer a seamless and user-friendly experience for reading and organizing digital book collections.
## :sparkles: Features
* Booklist Display: Booklink allows users to view a list of available books. These books are fetched from a remote source specified in a text file, making it easy to update and maintain the book collection.

* Book Selection: Users can select a book from the list by clicking on a corresponding button. This action triggers a smooth animation and displays the selected book's content.

* PDF Rendering: If the selected book is a PDF file, Booklink leverages PDF.js, a JavaScript library developed by Mozilla, to render the PDF content. The application dynamically creates a canvas element to display the PDF pages.

* Page Navigation: When viewing a PDF, Booklink provides navigation options to move between pages. Users can use arrow keys or input a specific page number to navigate through the document.

* Responsive Design: The application is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It provides a responsive layout that ensures optimal viewing and interaction across desktop and mobile platforms.
